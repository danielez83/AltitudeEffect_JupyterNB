# AltitudeEffect_JupyterNB - Isotopic lapse rate estimated with Rayleigh distillation

**Short summary:** In this notebook, we will simulate how the isotopic composition ($\delta^{18}$O and $\delta$D) of precipitation changes as a function of altitude. We will use a simplified version of the Rayleigh distillation model for an open system, coupled with basic parameterizations of atmospheric column dynamics. The isotopic lapse rate, also known as the altitude effect, will be obtained by following the path of Rayleigh distillation in the $\delta$ vs. Altitude (m ASL) space.
